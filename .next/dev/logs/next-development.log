[00:00:15.961] Server  ERROR   (node:54648) Warning: SECURITY WARNING: The SSL modes 'prefer', 'require', and 'verify-ca' are treated as aliases for 'verify-full'.
In the next major version (pg-connection-string v3.0.0 and pg v9.0.0), these modes will adopt standard libpq semantics, which have weaker security guarantees.

To prepare for this change:
- If you want the current behavior, explicitly use 'sslmode=verify-full'
- If you want libpq compatibility now, use 'uselibpqcompat=true&sslmode=require'

See https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-ssl.html for libpq SSL mode definitions.

[00:05:10.632] Browser ERROR   A tree hydrated but some attributes of the server rendered HTML didn't match the client properties. This won't be patched up. This can happen if a SSR-ed Client Component used:

- A server/client branch `if (typeof window !== 'undefined')`.
- Variable input such as `Date.now()` or `Math.random()` which changes each time it's called.
- Date formatting in a user's locale which doesn't match the server.
- External changing data without sending a snapshot of it along with the HTML.
- Invalid HTML tag nesting.

It can also happen if the client has a browser extension installed which messes with the HTML before React loaded.
